<p>When the author left England, in the autumn of 1892,
for a winter’s sunshine in Teneriffe, it was by no means
her intention to write on the Lepidoptera of that Island.
Soon after her arrival, however, she was struck by two
things; the want of any sort of interesting out-door
occupation (other than somewhat desultory riding expeditions)
experienced by her companions in exile, and
the absence of any account of the Lepidoptera of the
Canary Islands, which would enable collectors to name
their specimens. It is her hope that the present publication
may be, at least to some extent, the means of
remedying these deficiences.</p>

<p>To a detailed description of the Lepidoptera of Teneriffe,
so far as they are at present known, an introductory
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_x"></a>[Pg x]</span>chapter has been added, for the benefit of novices in the
study and collection of butterflies and moths.</p>

<p>Those, for whom fresh air and a certain amount of
exercise are essential, can hardly find any more health-giving
or light interesting occupation than the practical
study of Entomology.</p>

<p>This study lends an interest to excursions which
might otherwise be tedious, and leads the collector into
all sorts of beautiful and picturesque unexplored nooks
and corners of the Island, which to the ordinary traveller
are quite unknown. Many visitors hardly ever extend
their wanderings farther than the Carretera (the one
high road in Teneriffe), and have no idea of the many
beauties to be seen, or of the interest that may be found
in studying the Botany, as well as the Entomology, of
this most charming of the “Summer isles of Eden lying
in dark-purple spheres of sea.”</p>

<p>All the species and varieties of Teneriffe butterflies,
with the exception perhaps of three, are found between
the months of November and May; so that anyone
staying there for the winter and spring months may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xi"></a>[Pg xi]</span>
procure a tolerably perfect collection; more especially
as the different species found in Teneriffe are but
twenty-nine, so far as is at present known, all of which
are now described. The author has been fortunate
enough to add four of these to the number previously
known to exist in the Island.</p>

<p>The most complete collection of moths which came
under notice is in the possession of Dr. Zorolo, of Villa
Orotava, and this numbers about seventy species and
varieties. Forty-one moths are described out of some
fifty which were collected and studied by the author;
and a list of twenty-one others, chiefly small and of
little interest to the amateur collector, is appended.</p>

<p>Almost all the facts and particulars relating to the life
history of the Lepidoptera are the result of the personal
experience of the author, who is also responsible for
the drawings from which the illustrations have been
reproduced.</p>

<p>It is believed that the Lepidoptera of the other six
Islands are largely similar to those of Teneriffe. (see <a href="#APPENDIX_A" >Appendix A.</a>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xii"></a>[Pg xii]</span></p>

<p>The author desires to offer her best thanks to Señor
Don Ramon Gomez, of Puerto Orotava, for his kindness
and courtesy in placing his large collection of Lepidoptera
at her disposal for study and illustration.</p>

<p>The Rev. O. A. Benthall has kindly given information
upon specimens which he has netted and observed;
and the author is also indebted to Dr. Zorolo, of Yilla
Orotava, who has lent one or two rare specimens for
illustration. Kind assistance in naming some specimens
has been given by A. G. Butler, Ph.D., F.L.S.,
F.Z.S., and Mr. W. F. Kirby, F.L.S., F.E.S., of the
British Museum; and Mr. Bethune Baker, F.E.S., has
been good enough to name some of the smaller moths.</p>

<p>Many persons who know little or nothing about butterflies
may be tempted to make a collection of them when
they find themselves in a semi-tropical land, which yields
in great profusion such beautiful creatures, whose brilliant
colouring when grouped together has so pleasing an
effect. To such, a slight sketch of the life of a butterfly
may not be unacceptable.</p>

<p>Butterflies and moths belong to the order Lepidoptera
or Scale-winged insects. The different stages of growth
of these insects are called the&mdash;</p>

<table class="toa" summary="Butterflies">
  <tr>

<p>The body consists of three parts: the head, the thorax,
and the abdomen. There are two pairs of wings, the
upper and the lower; or, as they are generally called,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
the fore and the hind wings. These are covered with a
downy substance, like feathered scales, which are most
beautiful when seen under a microscope, and vary
much in form. It is in these that the colouring-matter
resides, which gives the beautiful colour to different
species. Lepidoptera have six legs; in some, however,
the fore-legs are so short and inconspicuous that the
insect almost appears to have only four legs. The proboscis
or trunk is a long flexible double tube through
which the animal sucks the juices of the flowers; it is
curled up under the thorax like a watch-spring, and expands
at will. It varies much in length both in moths
and butterflies. The antennæ are the horns or feelers
of the insect, and are believed to contain the organs of
smell. They vary much in size and thickness, and are
most important as regards the classification of the
different species of Lepidoptera. They are generally of
considerable length in a butterfly, increasing in thickness
at the end till a sort of long knob is formed.</p>

<p>Moths are distinguished from butterflies by a few
simple characteristics, which can be seen at a glance.</p>

<p>First, with some few exceptions, of which the Humming<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
Bird Hawk moth is one, moths are always found on the
wing at dusk, or at night, whereas butterflies take their
flight by day. Secondly, the moth either folds its wings
close to its side or else spreads them out flat. The
butterfly, when at rest, as a rule keeps its wings straight
up, face to face, or else keeps up a fluttering motion,
continually putting them in this position. Thirdly, the
body of a butterfly is small at the waist, while that of the
moth is larger, and of a more uniform size. The antennæ
are the most distinctive feature, those of the moth being
fine and long, and having no knob at the end. In some
species they are short and finely feathered the whole
length, terminating in a sharp point; this feature is
generally distinctive of the male sex; the Rufescens
moth being an example. The Skipper family have antennæ
like the butterfly, but the body of a moth.</p>

<p>The butterfly or moth lays its egg (not more than a
pin’s head in size) on that particular plant or tree on
which the caterpillar, that it will shortly become, feeds.
These look of much the same form to the naked eye, but
when magnified they are seen to be of many different
shapes, some being conical, others round, angular and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
many sided, &amp;c., &amp;c. The colours also of the eggs are
various, but most frequently they are yellow, green, or
greenish white. A microscopic examination of these
will prove both interesting and instructive.</p>

<p>The caterpillars, as soon as they emerge from the
eggs, the time of which varies with different species, at
once commence to eat, and continue to do so voraciously
till they turn to the pupa state. This being the case,
they must be constantly supplied with fresh food when
kept in captivity, once certainly, if not twice a day.
There are, however, one or two varieties which cease to
eat, and lie in a semi-dormant state for some time before
taking the form of a chrysalis; the caterpillar of the
Exoleta moth is an example of this. The greatest
cleanliness, together with good ventilation, freshness of
food, and regularity in feeding, are essential to keep all
caterpillars in health.</p>

<p>If we watch the creature feeding, we shall observe
that it takes the leaf edgeways between its two fore-feet,
ceaselessly moving its head up and down, and taking a
large piece of leaf at each mouthful. Some moth-caterpillars
are night-feeders, and so hide themselves under<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
the thickest leaves on which they feed, or else bury
themselves in the earth till night comes again.</p>

<p>Cannibal caterpillars are to be found on the potato-plants;
they are of rather a reddish brown colour,
from an inch and a half to two inches in length. The
author was not very fortunate in rearing them to the
moth-stage; it is said that they should be fed on the
young larvæ, and possibly the specimens had caterpillars
to feed on that were too old. There is room
for interesting experiments in Teneriffe on one, if not
more, species.</p>

<p>Many of the caterpillars are most beautifully coloured
and marked. Those of the Hawk-moth are usually the
most brilliant, but, at the same time, they are most
delicate, and require the greatest attention as regards
freshness of food, ventilation, and cleanliness.</p>

<p>Some larvæ shed their skins twice only, others moult
seven times; but the majority effect this change four or
five times. This is rather a laborious process for them,
and sometimes proves fatal. During the process they
cease feeding, but commence again with renewed vigour
after the change has taken place. The colourings and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
markings of the new coat often vary from those of the
one cast off, and an experienced entomologist can tell
the age of the caterpillar by the colour and texture of
the skin in many varieties. When the creature has
passed through the larva and arrived at the pupa state,
it has at first a soft and tender skin, through which parts
of the future butterfly can be clearly seen; this soon
hardens, however, and forms a case impervious to rain
or other atmospheric influences.</p>

<p>Before taking the pupa form some caterpillars creep
into holes and crevices of walls and old buildings, others
bury themselves in the earth; some envelop themselves
in a tissue of silk which they spin as a silkworm does,
and this case is called a cocoon. Other species draw a
leaf round their bodies, fastening it together with silk-like
threads, and so making a complete shelter for itself.
The Aurifera caterpillar is an example of this type,
being commonly found in Teneriffe on the potato plant,
from the leaf of which it constructs its house. Still
further varieties suspend themselves to a bough or leaf
head downwards. There are other varieties which
suspend themselves from the centre of their bodies<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[Pg 7]</span>
by silk-like threads, and use much ingenuity in so
doing.</p>

<p>Many caterpillars are smooth, others rough and hairy.
The hairy specimens vary much, the hair of some being
soft, long, and silky, others having short stubby spikes
rather than hairs sparsely dispersed over the body.
The hairy species (the Rufescens moth caterpillar being
one) use their hairy coats as a slight cocoon, and the
hairy coat also, it is said, serves as a protection from
birds; at the same time the hairs cause great irritation
to the human skin if the caterpillars are handled too
freely. The acrid taste of some also protects them
from feathered enemies. When the insect has remained
in the pupa state for a sufficient length of time, which
varies according to species from a couple of weeks to a
few months, the process of throwing off its skin is
quickly performed. Weather has much influence on
the period during which the pupa lies dormant. The
Teneriffe winter of 1892-93 was particularly warm, and
all specimens emerged to the butterfly stage somewhat
earlier than usual.</p>

<p>A few days before the butterfly or moth appears, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
pupa becomes less lively, and at last splits its skin down
the middle of the back, and the insect squeezes first its
head and front legs through the aperture. This aperture
soon enlarges, the pupa skin being very dry and
giving little resistance, and the creature emerges, its
legs clinging to some substance so that the wings are in
a suspended position. These are quite small at first
and wet, but they expand very quickly, acquire their
full size, and become firm and stiff as the animal flutters
and crawls about. The insect then emits a quantity of
reddish fluid, and in a short time it is able to fly away.
The duration of the life of Lepidoptera varies much,
most species living a few days or a few weeks, but some
hibernate. The flight of Lepidoptera is a very distinctive
feature of the different species, the larger, such as
the Plexippus, Chrysippus and Pandora, seem to sail
through the air, sometimes rising to a great height.
The Cardui and Huntera have a much quicker and more
jerky flight, and are troublesome to net. A great many
of the large moths may be said to rush along, the Convolvuli
being a very difficult one to capture, and often
escaping when it seems quite within the net. Taking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
the flight of the majority of moths and butterflies, they
seem to be more active and stronger on the wing in
Teneriffe than those of the same species in England.</p>

<p>The food of Lepidoptera consists of honey which they
take from the flowers, or else a moisture which exudes
from trees or plants. Their food is always of a liquid
form, and is sucked up through the proboscis or long
tongue. The Convolvuli moth hovers at dusk over
flowers, inserting its very long tube into the extremity
of trumpet-shaped blossoms.</p>

<p>When forming a collection of the Lepidoptera of
Teneriffe, it seems a pity that so many insects should
be unnecessarily caught and destroyed, and the author
would earnestly beg all lovers and collectors of the
beautiful creatures to bear this in mind, as some of
the rarer varieties may otherwise stand a good chance
of being exterminated.</p>

<p>The “muchachos”  (Spanish boys) are all too eager to
supply any collector with specimens for a few “quartos,”
and bring many poor mutilated insects in the hope of
finding a purchaser. A refusal to buy the much befingered
and dilapidated creatures does not deter them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
from further pursuit, as they only endeavour to catch a
greater quantity in the hope of at last getting a good
specimen which will find a buyer. If collectors would
only net them themselves, and not encourage the indiscriminate
way in which the boys pursue them, it would
greatly tend to preserve the different species.</p>

BREEDING-CAGES, <span class="smcap">Etc.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>As some difficulty is experienced in Teneriffe by
persons who arrive there without already being provided
with materials for collecting Lepidoptera, the description
of a few useful expedients resorted to may be of service.
A moderate knowledge of the Spanish language is a very
useful help towards obtaining any small necessaries, but
the Spanish shop-keepers are most obliging, and understand
quickly by the help of a very few words what is
wanted.</p>

<p>A butterfly-net is one of the first requisites, so some
wire must be bought at the tin-smiths, of whom there
are several in Orotava. With a little instruction he
will make it into a ring about one foot in diameter,
with a socket of tin soldered on to it. Into this socket
an ordinary walking-stick can be fixed for a handle.
The stick is useful to walk with over the rough ground<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
when not required for the net, and the net can be easily
carried with other necessaries one has to take on an
expedition.</p>

<p>Mosquito-netting answers the purpose of green gauze
for the net. Gauze is the best, however, and can be
purchased in England, but not in Orotava. The
mosquito-netting gets soft and pliable by use, but it is
best to scald it in hot water before making it into a net,
so as to insure a soft substance in which to catch the
fragile creatures without injuring their wings or plumage.
The net should be made round at the bottom, and be
about a yard in length. Purchase a yard of mosquito-netting;
it is sold two yards in width, and the quantity
which is not used for the net serves to cover the
breeding-cages, which are about to be described.</p>

<p>Another essential is a breeding-cage for caterpillars,
and, as several are required if many butterflies and
moths are to be reared, the following plan is a good one
to adopt. Procure a small wooden box, about 6 or
8 inches long, or even larger, and about 3 inches deep;
empty chocolate boxes are serviceable for the purpose.
In each corner fix upright, with a couple of tacks, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
piece of cane about 8 or 10 inches in length. Over this
stretch a piece of mosquito-netting, tacking it to the
edge of the box all round, except at one side, where it
should be left loose, so as to be fastened down at will
with two or three stout pins. The loose side can then
be raised to give the caterpillars fresh food, and to
remove dirt or refuse. Breeding-cages that one can
purchase at any naturalists’ outfitters are made very
handily of wood, zinc, and glass, and of course are very
durable, but those described above last well for a season,
and have the merit of being of no expense.</p>

<p>To procure good moths and butterflies with bright
and uninjured plumage, it is best to rear them from the
caterpillar stage of development, but as all varieties are
not easily found, the net is usually the collector’s first
resource. Raising caterpillars from the egg is a very
interesting process, but it is rather tedious, and requires
more knowledge and experience to meet with success
than finding the insects in the next stage of development,
and keeping them till they reach the perfect
state.</p>

<p>When starting for a day’s ramble butterfly-hunting,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
one of the great charms seems to be the delightful uncertainty
about the sport which may fall to one’s lot, so
it is as well to provide for all contingencies, taking the
net, poison-box, or bottle, a tin for caterpillars (which
should be perforated at the top), a nest of glass-topped
pill-boxes for specimens of any butterfly or moth one
may wish to take home alive, and envelopes for butterflies
when killed in the net. The latter may be made of
note-paper, by cutting a long square of paper and folding
it in a triangular shape, and then turning up the edges
of two sides, so as to make a little bag.</p>

<p>Butterflies travel well placed flat in these envelopes,
and should be set directly home is reached. A small
cork collecting-box is also useful, together with some
insect-pins, in case one gets many specimens, some of
which can be pinned into the box preparatory to setting
them on the return home.</p>

<p>Insect life is so prolific in Teneriffe, and one sees so
many strange and curious animals, that anyone really
interested in Entomology is certain to find specimens to
bring home, such as the “Praying Mantis,”  found
frequently on half dead thistles in “barrancos”  and on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
shrubs, the many varieties of large grasshopper, and the
gorgeous coloured dragon-flies flitting about and killing
butterflies in a rather wholesale manner.</p>

<p>All these insects are of such interest, that it is as
well to be provided with various appliances for carrying
them on the homeward journey.</p>

<p>As sunshine and brightness prevail in Teneriffe during
the winter months, it is not necessary to choose a
“likely”  day, as in England, in order to have a good
day’s sport, indeed there seem to be more butterflies
on the wing on the days that are not too brilliant. On
the very sunshiny days the butterflies are about in the
greatest quantities in the early morning, retiring at noon
to more shady or sheltered spots. A nice quiet
sheltered little dell, covered with rough herbage and
cactus by the sides of the barrancos, is a very favourite
spot. The barrancos are dry river-beds, sometimes of
great extent, with large boulders and rocks thrown
about in wild confusion; generally speaking they are
intersected by a path, up which one can ride or walk,
leading up the mountains to different villages and
hamlets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span></p>

<p>Occasionally, during the winter months, a great
quantity of water runs down the barrancos, but the
supply only lasts a short time, soon drying up, and
leaving a few small stagnant pools here and there,
and these in turn soon disappear.</p>

<p>Walking over much ground is hard work, as the
country is steep, and rough with stones and rocks.
I advocate strongly the use of mules, as being the
most pleasant mode of locomotion. They are so sure-footed
and easy in their quick walk, that one feels far
less tired after a long day’s excursion on mule-back up
the mountains and barrancos, than by any other mode
of locomotion. The muleteer carries all necessaries,
together with luncheon, and one is able to stop and
alight where fancy dictates or butterflies abound.
Mules can be hired at Villa Orotava, the charge being
one dollar, or five pesetas, for a short day; beyond this
a small gratuity to the muleteer makes him pleased and
happy.</p>

<p>There are many completely uncultivated spots up the
mountains, intersected by little bye-paths along which
the mules can walk; these are perfect “Eldorados”  for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
moths and butterflies, and one must be busy with net
and poison-box, not forgetting the tin case in which to
place larvæ for the breeding-cage, and especially remembering
to carry home some of the plant upon which they
feed.</p>

<p>Some of these places are so rough and thick with
bramble growth, and vegetation of like nature, that
walking is really hard work. The lava-rocks are sharp,
and the numerous grasses with hooks, such as the
“Amour Sec,”  together with the thorns of the prickly
pear, make a formidable barrier for the pedestrian.
There are, however, no poisonous snakes to dread, no
biting animals of any sort larger than flies, so that the
inconvenience of the thorns and pricks is all that need
be feared.</p>

<p>On returning home from the expedition, all the various
wants and requirements of the specimens must be
attended to. The caterpillars have to be put into
breeding-cages, which should have been already prepared
for them. Different kinds which feed on the
same plant may be put together. Care must, however,
be taken not to put any cannibal species, such as the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
Armigera, among the others; also moth and butterfly
larvæ should be kept separate.</p>

<p>For moth larvæ it is essential to have some fine earth
(previously baked to destroy the ants, which are very
troublesome) spread on the bottom of the box, from 1 to
2 inches thick. The caterpillars bury themselves in this
when they have finished feeding, making for themselves
a slight mould of earth, welded together with silk-like
threads. Different species, however, vary in their mode
of procedure, some making very slight, and others more
pronounced cocoons; while yet others make quite an
oval shell, choosing only the finest grains of earth with
which to construct their houses.</p>

<p>It is said that some sort of dried leaf answers the
purpose of earth, and is less likely to injure the moth’s
plumage, but the former mode has been found to be
perfectly successful. Place the plant on which the
animal is to feed in a moist pot of earth, or in a bottle of
water, so as to keep it fresh. If the latter mode is
adopted, care must be taken that the animal does not
drop into the water; so it is best to choose a wide-mouthed
bottle, putting a bung with a hole in it as a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
stopper, and inserting the plant through the hole into
the water. The earth should be kept slightly moist, and
many people give caterpillars a gentle spray of water
occasionally to take the place of dew, which they would
have in their natural state. It is a good plan to let them
have a little of the early morning sun upon them, as
it serves to keep them in health, but they cannot bear
the sun of mid-day.</p>

<p>For butterfly larvæ the same procedure is required,
except that only a thin sprinkling of earth is wanted at
the bottom of the box for the purposes of cleanliness.</p>

<p>When the larva of the butterfly is about to develop to
its pupa state, it readily crawls up the box and netting,
suspending itself, from the top head-downwards, and the
netting serves as a good foot-hold for the butterfly when
it appears. If possible the chrysalides should remain as
they place themselves until the next stage of development
is reached; because, unless they are able to expand their
wings while in this position, deformity is likely to ensue.</p>

<p>The majority of butterfly chrysalides are naked, and
of an angular form, some being remarkable for the brilliancy
with which they are spotted with gold and silver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span></p>

<p>The Vanessa family is an example of this, the Vulcania
and Huntera being especially brilliant.</p>

<p>Caterpillars of the “Skipper”  family make a web-like
covering of silk for the reception of the chrysalides,
but there has been hitherto only one species of this family
found in Teneriffe.</p>

<p>Many caterpillars of various kinds kept during the
winter months were very subject to the raids of the
Ichneumon fly. This fly lays its egg on the larva,
and it is not easily perceived on the animal unless looked
for through a magnifying-glass.</p>

<p>The caterpillar lives on, and seemingly thrives, but
after it has turned to its pupa state the fly develops,
and a fine Ichneumon fly appears in the breeding-cage
instead of the expected butterfly. There are large and
small varieties of this fly, the former laying only one or
two eggs on the caterpillar, the latter a great many,
and they emerge from the chrysalis in corresponding
numbers.<a name="fnanchor_1_1" id="fnanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The only remedy seems to be to inspect all
larvæ through a magnifying-glass, and to reject any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
infected specimens. Pieris Cheiranthi is particularly
liable to this fly. The red fungus found on the Tithymali
moth caterpillar is another disease, but is not very
common.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="footnote_1_1" id="footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#fnanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>This occurrence is mentioned by Gilbert White in his “Natural
History of Selborne,”  v. “Observations on Insects and Vermes,” p. 519.
Ed. 1813.</p></div>

<p>Caterpillars should be handled as little as possible
while removing them to their fresh food. As a rule,
they crawl on to the fresh supply at once, but in the
case of very small specimens a camel-hair brush
should be used to lift them from one place to another.
Many of them emit a fluid when touched. The Tithymali
spits out a quantity of green fluid when disturbed.</p>

<p>Butterflies generally seem to be found in the greatest
numbers in the barrancos early in the year. When,
however, the fields get green and vegetation increases,
they desert the barrancos and take more to the fields
and country, with the exception of the Argynnis
Lathonia, a variety which more particularly frequents
barrancos.</p>

<p>The time of appearance of all species takes place
from two to four weeks later the higher they are up
the mountains. The south part of the island is not so
fertile a place for Lepidoptera as the north; perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
this is owing to the more sparse vegetation on that
side.</p>

<p>Many species are found inland, while some are
peculiar to the coast. The heights and localites in
which all the different kinds are found have been
indicated as far as possible in the description of the
various species.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="KILLING_AND_SETTING_BUTTERFLIES_AND">KILLING AND SETTING BUTTERFLIES AND
MOTHS, RELAXING-SPECIMENS, <span class="smcap">Etc.</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Butterflies</span>, when netted, can be easily killed by a prolonged
sharp pinch under the thorax before being taken
from the net, and do not need to be put into a poison-box.
The pinch should be given between the finger and
thumb, the wings of the insect being kept in an upright
position.</p>

<p>Moths must be put into a poison-bottle or box, and
left there from twelve to twenty-four hours. Some
varieties die much quicker than others. Various kinds
of poison are used for the boxes and bottles, but cyanide
of potassium seems most generally approved of by
entomologists. To catch moths, many people use the
sugaring process. A mixture, made of beer, rum, and
coarse sugar or treacle, boiled till it becomes thick like<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
treacle is placed at night on the trunks of trees or on
flowers, and a lamp is placed near the sugared plants.
True votaries of “sweetness and light,”  the moths alight
on the sticky mixture, and, becoming stupefied with the
beer and rum, as a rule fall to the ground, where they
can easily be caught or netted.</p>

<p>Setting-boards are made of strips of wood about one
foot or eighteen inches in length, varying in width
according to the size of the specimen one wishes to pin
out on it. These boards are covered with sheet cork,
having a groove down the middle to receive the body of
the insect. Some boards have a flat, others a slightly
curved surface, and these are covered with white paper.
English entomologists generally use curved boards, but
foreign collectors prefer the flat setting-boards. These
latter seem somewhat preferable.</p>

<p>The good appearance and value of a collection greatly
depend on the setting, and for this reason much care
and patience is required. The butterfly should be taken
between the thumb and finger of the left hand, and an
insect-pin inserted in the middle of the thorax, bringing
the point slightly sloping backwards and out at the legs.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
Then having selected a board suitable in size to the
specimen, it should be pinned exactly in the middle of
the groove, the body being kept quite straight. Two
narrow strips of paper, not more than ⅛th of an inch in
width, are now required to fasten down the two wings
on each side of the groove. Let each strip be pinned in
front of the two fore-wings, holding the end of a strip in
the left hand; then very gently place the wings, first
the fore and then the hind-wing, in position, bringing
them forward with a long pin (the point being placed on
the wings as near the body as possible) in the right
hand. At the same time the strip of paper which is
being held in the left hand is gently lowered and
fastened with a pin immediately below the hind-wing.
Great care must be taken not to injure the plumage by
touching it. A second strip of paper is now necessary
on each side to pin down the outer edges of the wings;
but the first two strips are the most important ones, as
they keep the wings in position, and the latter may be
very easily added. The antennæ should be straightened
and placed under the first two strips of paper, or placed
in position by two pins. The paper is fastened along<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
the boards, fixing as many specimens as its length will
permit.</p>

<p>Many persons use triangular pieces of card as braces
for the butterfly, fixing one or more on each wing, but
the strips of paper seem somewhat easier to arrange, and
damage the plumage even less than the card, though
when either method is adopted the specimen ought not
to be damaged in the least. In making a perfect collection
of butterflies three specimens should be set up of
every variety; the male, the female, and one set with
the underside uppermost. It is not usual to set moths
the reverse way.</p>

<p>Butterflies must be left on the board to stiffen for
ten days or a fortnight; after that they can be removed
to the store-box. Moths with large bodies take longer in
drying, and must be left for three or four weeks. By
touching the end of the body of a specimen gently with
a pin it can easily be seen whether it is firm and stiff
enough to be removed to the case. If butterflies and
moths are not set soon after death they become stiff,
and would be useless; but there are several modes of
relaxing them, and it may be useful to give a description<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
of the process which is generally adopted. Procure a
marmalade-pot or earthenware jar, into which put three
inches of sand; pour on the sand enough water to wet
it thoroughly, without allowing the water to appear on
the surface. It is as well to put a small quantity of
carbolic acid with it. The insects to be relaxed should
be pinned on to a thick piece of cork, the cork resting
on the top of the sand. Close the mouth of the jar
with a piece of glass, or something which will make it
air-tight. A few hours is often enough to relax specimens,
but if left longer they must be carefully watched,
as they very soon become mouldy. To keep the insects
free from mites, napthaline must be freely used in the
store-boxes and cases. Camphor is used by some
persons, but napthaline is a far more efficacious preventive
of the ravages of parasites.</p>

<p>In packing specimens already set for England, store-boxes
will hold a great number if the specimens are
judiciously placed one over the other in a sloping
manner, great care being taken that they do not touch
each other, as the slightest rubbing spoils the plumage.</p>

<p>Don Ramon Gomez, chemist, of Puerto Orotava,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
Teneriffe, has all necessaries for the collector, such as
setting-boards, store-boxes, pins, etc., etc., and is most
obliging in packing specimens for England and giving
any advice.</p>

<p>Many interesting objects for the naturalist and antiquarian
may be seen in his large collection, his Guanche
remains being especially deserving of notice.</p>

<h3>PIERIS CHEIRANTHI.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Plate <abbr title="1">I</abbr>.&mdash;Fig. 2.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is a large creamy-white butterfly peculiar to the
Canary Islands. It is found in some numbers on and
near the coast of Teneriffe from April to September;
the time of its appearance, however, varies somewhat in
different years. The larva is smooth, and has a ground-colour
of grey, finely dotted over with black spots.
There is a yellow stripe on the back and along each side.
It feeds on the nasturtium gregariously, and the pupa
attaches itself, head downwards, to a wall near the plant.</p>

<p>The female butterfly, the underside of which is illustrated,
has a long uneven blotch of black on the surface
of the fore-wings; the male has none. The upper sur<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>face
of both sexes is cream-white, with a black apical
patch on the fore-wings. The under-sides have the long
black blotch as seen on the surface of the female, and
the ground-colour of both is yellow, finely sprinkled
with black dots. The measurement across the wings
varies from two and a half to three and a half inches.</p>

<p>It is best to procure the larvæ to obtain good specimens,
but the Ichneumon fly is such an enemy to this
species that great disappointment will probably be
experienced in the rearing if the caterpillars are not well
examined before being placed in the breeding-cages.</p>


<h3>PIERIS WOLLASTONI.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Plate <abbr title="1">I</abbr>.&mdash;Fig. 1.</span></p>

<p>This butterfly is allied to the Cheiranthi, but is a
distinct variety, only recently met with in this island.
Mr. Butler, of the British Museum, has named and
fully described this insect, which has hitherto only been
found in Madeira, but is now for the first time enumerated
in the list of Teneriffe Lepidoptera. It is somewhat
smaller than the Cheiranthi, measuring not more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
than two and a half inches in expanse. The reverses
of the female (which is illustrated) and of the male are
of a grey tinge, in place of the rather bright yellow
shade of the Cheiranthi, sprinkled over with fine black
dots. The apical patch is also grey, and both sexes
have long black spots on the fore-wings. The upper
surface is cream-white; the female has two distinctly
marked long black spots on the fore-wings; the male
having none. The black apical markings are similar in
both sexes, and a small black spot is seen on the inner
margin of the hind-wing of both male and female.</p>

<p>There are no observations to record on the caterpillar
and pupa, as the specimens of the fly (one of which is
illustrated) were netted; but very possibly larvæ may be
found gregariously with the Cheiranthi in like manner
to the Callirrhoe and Atalanta, or the Plexippus and
Chrysippus.</p>

<p>The specimens taken were netted about 500 feet
above the sea.</p>


<h3>PIERIS RAPÆ.</h3>

<p>The common English variety, Small Cabbage White.
The fore-wings are creamy white, with an irregular<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
blackish mark at the tip. The male generally has a
black spot in the middle of the wing, the female having
two; and both sexes have two black spots on the underside,
which is of a yellowish colour, thickly dotted with
small black atoms. All the markings vary greatly, however.
The larva is dull green, with a yellowish stripe
on its back and yellow dots on the side. It generally
feeds on the cabbage, but is found also on the nasturtium.
It is very common, and may be found everywhere
from February to October. The Ichneumon fly is
a great enemy to this insect.</p>


<h3>PIERIS DAPLIDICE.</h3>

<p>This butterfly resembles the rare English specimen
Bath White. It is very common in some years,<a name="fnanchor_2_2" id="fnanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and
found in most localities from February to October. It
seems mostly to frequent rough poorly-cultivated fields.
The wings are white, the fore-wings having a large
black spot in the middle, and being bordered with black
encircling distinct white spots. The markings of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
under-side show through on the hind-wings, and these
have black markings on the edges in the female. The
underside has a ground colour of sage-green, freely
spotted with white. The markings show considerable
variety, some being marked much more heavily than
others. It measures across the wings from two to two
and a half inches. The caterpillar, which is greyish
green, has yellow stripes on the back, and feeds generally
on cabbage. The butterflies are much pursued and
destroyed by dragon-flies.</p>

<p><a name="footnote_2_2" id="footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#fnanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> During the winter of 1892-1893 it was met with in great numbers.

<h3>EUCHLOË CHARLONIA (Donzil).</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Plate <abbr title="1">I</abbr>.&mdash;Fig. 4.</span></p>

<p>This butterfly was seen near Orotava, 500 feet above
the sea-level, during the first week in May by the author,
who, however, was not fortunate enough to secure a
specimen. Several specimens of this species, which is
rare in the Canary Islands, have been netted in the
island of Fuerteventura, and two of them have been presented
by Mr. E. H. Hodges, of Rugby, to the British
Museum, from which the illustration has been drawn.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
It measures in expanse about an inch and a half. The
general colour is yellow, varying in intensity of shade in
different specimens, with black apical markings on the
fore wings and a long black patch on the centre of the
upper margin. A full account of this interesting insect
is to be found in Ann. Soc. Ent. Fr., 1842, p. 197, f. 1,
but hitherto it has not been recognized in Teneriffe as
a species belonging to the island. It is found in North
and West Africa.</p>


<h3>APORIA CRATÆGI.</h3>

<p>This specimen is the rare English Black-veined
White butterfly. It has undoubtedly been netted in
Teneriffe, though it has not been personally observed
by the author. In flight its similarity to other white
specimens is so great that it may often be passed unnoticed.
It is said to be local and uncertain in appearance,
being seen chiefly during the summer months about
the fields and gardens. The wings are entirely of a
white cream colour, and are alike on both sides, the
veins being black, and the fore-wings having some
dusky spots on them. The caterpillar is black, thickly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
sprinkled with whitish hairs, and with a reddish yellow
stripe running along each side. It feeds on various
fruit trees, and is believed to be very destructive.</p>


<h3>RHODOCERA CLEOBULE.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Plate <abbr title="1">I</abbr>.&mdash;Fig. 3.</span></p>

<p>This finely-coloured and beautiful butterfly resembles
the English Brimstone, but is quite a distinct variety,
being of squarer form and having no decided point at the
angle of the hind-wings. It is peculiar to the Islands.
The male is a most brilliant sulphur yellow, the fore-wings
being of a deeper shade than the hind ones. The
hind-wings have a deep orange spot about the centre.
The female differs from the male in being of a much
paler shade of yellow, with quite a tinge of green all over
it; it also has a small orange spot on the fore-wings in
addition to that on the hind-wings. Both wings have
red markings round them on the outer edge, which form
an almost interrupted fine line of colour. The underside
resembles the upper, but is paler. The antennæ
are short and thick, with a reddish tinge, which becomes
deeper at the knob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span></p>

<p>It is found from January to June in most localities
on and at a little distance from the coast; gardens and
fields seem somewhat favoured, but it is by no means
common anywhere. There seem to be several broods
between the months mentioned above, but the larva and
pupa have not been observed.</p>


<h3>COLIAS EDUSA.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Plate <abbr title="1">I</abbr>.&mdash;Fig. 5</span> (female).</p>

<p>This specimen is the English Clouded Yellow. The
wings measure from two to two and a half inches
across, the female being somewhat larger than the
male. Both sexes have the same broad black margin
on the fore and hind-wings, but the male differs from
the female in having no irregular yellow spots marked
on these black borders, which are seen in the female.
The hind-wings of the female are of a somewhat darker
shade of yellow, tinged with green, than those of the
male, and both sexes have a bright orange spot about
the middle of the wing. Beneath, both sexes are alike,
the fore-wings being of a lighter orange with several<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
irregular black spots and a margin of greenish yellow.
The hind-wings are of a uniform green colour with a
red ringed spot about the centre of each, accompanied
by a silver-like dot in the middle. It is found in
quantities in most localities, from the coast to the pine
forests, from February to November. The caterpillar
is green, with a stripe of yellow and white, having several
orange dots on it. It is a miscellaneous feeder, preferring,
however, leguminous plants.</p>


<h3>COLIAS v. HELICE.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Plate <abbr title="1">I</abbr>.&mdash;Fig. 6.</span></p>

<p>A pale yellowish-white variety of the former specimen.
It is very rare, and is found in May and during
the summer months, though very seldom met with in
England.<a name="fnanchor_3_3" id="fnanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> It is slightly smaller than the Colias Edusa,
and has been found so small as to measure only an inch
across the wings. Don Ramon Gomez has one in his
collection of this size. The markings vary considerably,
and the bright orange spot in the centre of the hind-wing,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
as seen in the illustration, is replaced occasionally by a
pure white one. The male has hitherto not been found.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="footnote_3_3" id="footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#fnanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a>In the summer of 1892 many were taken.
</p></div>


<h3>LYCÆNA BÆTICA.</h3>

<p>A commonly found blue butterfly, measuring from one
to one and a half inches across the wings. It is rarely
met with in England. The insect has a slender tail at the
lower angle of each hind-wing, surmounted by two black
dots. The margins of both wings have a slight black
or dark brown band. The under-sides of both wings
are of a grey-brown colour streaked and slightly spotted
all over with faint white lines. On the lower angle of
each hind-wing the two black spots on the upper side
are replaced by two black ones dusted with silver, and
surrounded by a bright orange ring which is broader
at the top than at the bottom.</p>

<p>The antennæ are brown, slightly sprinkled with
white. It is found on the rough fields (especially where
the Lupine grows), barrancos, and hedge-rows, between
March and August. Specimens netted early in the year
are not so large as those found during May, and in the
summer months.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span></p>


<h3>LYCÆNA WEBSIANA.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Plate <abbr title="1">I</abbr>.&mdash;Figs. 7 and 8.</span></p>

<p>This is a smaller blue butterfly than that just described,
measuring about one inch across the wings. It is peculiar
to the Islands, and is known by some lovers of Entomology
as the “Peak Blue.”  It is not, however, found
on the Peak alone, but is netted in barrancos and gardens
at a much lower altitude; it frequents the pine forests in
large numbers, and has been also found on the south coast
of the Island of Teneriffe, at Guimar (see <a href="#APPENDIX_B" >Appendix B</a>),
so it may be fairly considered to be widely dispersed
over the Island. It is undoubtedly found in the greatest
numbers in the elevated zone of the pine forests, where,
however, owing to the extremely slippery nature of the
ground, it is difficult to net. The male is of a beautiful
metallic blue colour; the female of a much browner blue.
The upperside of the male, and the underside of the
female, are shown in the illustrations.</p>

<p>The fore-wings of the underside in both sexes are
alike, being of an orange tawny colour, with a white<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
uneven spot on the top margin of each wing, and five or
six somewhat indistinct brown spots at the outer edge,
interspersed with white.</p>

<p>The hind-wings are of an ashy brown, with a longitudinal,
irregular silver white line down each, both wings
being minutely dotted with white. Five or six brown
spots, dusted with silver, are seen at the margin of the
hind-wings. It usually appears in March, though it has
been seen at an earlier date. The larva and pupa have
not hitherto been found.</p>


<h3>LYCÆNA LYSIMON.</h3>

<p>This is the smallest specimen of blue butterfly found in
Teneriffe, being not quite one inch in expanse. The
female is rather a browner blue than the male. The
colouring on the upperside is of a most beautiful
uniform blue, all the wings having a margin of brown;
and a slight white fringe at the edges. The underside of
all the wings is grey, rather freely dotted over with
darker spots, encircled by greyish white. It is very
commonly found on all grassy fields and lanes, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
quantities flutter quickly along the grass-grown streets
of Orotava from April to August.</p>

<p>It is not an inhabitant of England, but is found in the
south of France, Spain, greater part of Africa, Western
Asia, and the East Indies. The caterpillar and chrysalis
have not been observed.</p>


<h3>LYCÆNA ASTRARCHE v. ÆSTIVA.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Plate <abbr title="2">II</abbr>.&mdash;Fig. 6.</span></p>

<p>A small dark copper, the expanse of wings being about
one inch, or rather more. It is not found in England.
On the upperside on all the wings there is a marginal
band of bright copper, the fore-wings have a black spot
about the centre of each. A fringe of white edges all
the four wings. The under widely differs from the
upper side in colouring and markings. The ground
colour is light grey, freely dotted over with black spots
encircled by white. All four wings have the same
bright marginal copper band as seen on the upper side.
The antennæ are black or dark brown, finely dotted with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
white. It is somewhat rarely found in fields and
barrancos on high ground, but may be met with in
larger quantities in the pine forests. The time of its
appearance is from April to September. When comparing
the Teneriffe specimen of this butterfly with
those of other countries at South Kensington, it was
noticed that the marginal copper band was broader on
the Teneriffe specimen, and it may be possible that it
should be reckoned as a new variety.</p>


<h3>POLYOMMATUS or CHRYSOPHANUS PHLÆAS.</h3>

<p>A copper butterfly, and a common English specimen,
measuring from one to one and a half inches across
the wings. The fore-wings are of a bright copper
red, with large square black spots distinctly marked,
and an outer band of brown. The hind-wings are
dark brown, having a marginal copper band on the
outer edge, which in some specimens is surmounted by
a few blue spots. The underside of the fore-wings is
pale copper, the hind-wings being grey, with minute
black or dark brown spots, and traces of a marginal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
band of copper. It is commonly found from February
to September in most places in Teneriffe, up to the
altitude of the pine forests. The larva feeds on a
variety of Rumex (dock or sorrel). Some specimens
have been found much darker in colour than those
described above, the difference being so great as to
suggest the possibility of a distinct variety.</p>


<h3>THECLA RUBI.</h3>

<p>This small butterfly is called in England the Green
Hair Streak, It is said to have been netted in the
Island during the summer months, and its appearance is
believed to be well authenticated. The larva is green,
with a yellow line on the back, bordered with darker,
and followed by a line of pale triangular spots, and a
yellow line on the sides: it lives on brambles, &amp;c.
The fly expands about one inch; it is of a uniform
brown colour above, and a uniform green below, with
a row of white dots on the underside of the hind-wings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span></p>


<h3>DANAIS PLEXIPPUS, formerly ARCHIPPUS.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Plate <abbr title="2">II</abbr>.&mdash;Fig. 1.</span></p>

<p>The largest butterfly found in the Islands, measuring
from four to four and a half inches across the wings.</p>

<p>The larva is very bright in colour, having transverse
bands of blackish violet, gold, and white alternately.
It has four black horns or fleshy spikes along its back,
and when full grown measures about two inches in
length, and it is rather stout and smooth. The pupa,
green when first turned, and suspending itself by the
tail only, has a bright gold band half-way round its
base, and a series of gold spots encircling its head.
Shortly before emerging to a butterfly, it turns to a
dark brown. The caterpillar never suspends itself to
the plant on which it feeds, but goes to some of the
higher grasses near it, or it prefers still better a mallow
plant, from the leaves of which as many as sixteen
beautiful bright green and gold chrysalides have been
seen hanging, forming quite a picture under the illumination
of the glorious sun of Teneriffe. It lives and feeds<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
gregariously on the “Arbol de Seda,” <a name="fnanchor_4_4" id="fnanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> a plant bearing a
very bright red and gold flower. Many specimens were
reared from quite small caterpillars in the breeding-cages.
They were easy to keep, but especial care must
be taken in providing them with fresh food, and great
attention ought to be paid to ventilation, or some disappointment
may be experienced in the number that die
during the pupa state for no apparent reason. A little of
the morning sun is beneficial to them, as they are found,
when in a natural state, in the most sunny localities.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="footnote_4_4" id="footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#fnanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> Asclepias cuvassavica. </p></div>


<p>A brood seems to emerge about every three months
in most years from February to September. The
butterfly frequents flower-gardens and fields near the
coast, not often being found more than seven or eight
hundred feet above the sea. It is of a rich orange
tawny colour, rather heavily veined with black or dark
brown. All four wings have a broad black border,
with two lines of whitish yellow dots along the margin.
There is a large apical patch of blackish brown on each
fore-wing, with seven large yellow and white spots on
the tip. There is not a great difference between the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
upper and the under side, except that on the latter the
white marginal spots are larger, and there is more white
on the black-feathered body.</p>

<p>The insect looks splendidly bright and flashing as it
soars along with a steady flight from tree to tree on
the “Carretera,”  and it must be quickly netted, or it
soon rises out of reach. These butterflies are distasteful
to birds, as also are the three following varieties belonging
to the same family. For this reason the family of
Danais is “mimicked”  by butterflies of other species,
the butterfly next described (Danais Chrysippus) being,
for instance, copied closely by several African and
Indian species of butterflies and even some moths.</p>

<p>The Danais Plexippus is a very common butterfly in
North America, and has within the last few years become
widely dispersed, some specimens having been found in
England in 1877 and subsequently.</p>


<h3>DANAIS CHRYSIPPUS.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Plate <abbr title="2">II</abbr>.&mdash;Fig. 2.</span></p>

<p>This butterfly is widely dispersed over Europe, Asia,
and Africa, but it is not found in England. It is of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
the same colour as the last described specimen, but is
not so large, measuring in expanse from two and a half
to three and a half inches. The tips of the fore-wings
are broadly marked with black, shading off to brown,
crossed with a band of white spots. Four of these
spots are of a quadrilateral form, and much larger than
the rest. The outer margins of all four wings are
bordered with black, freely dotted with white. There
are three black spots on the centre of the hind-wings of
the female; the male has four, the fourth, which is
largest, being placed under the principal vein. The
under is similar in markings and colouring to the upper
side, but the white spots are more pronounced, and the
tawny yellow somewhat paler; the apex of each fore-wing
is moreover tipped with yellow, instead of being
black like the upperside. The larva is very similar to
that of the Plexippus. It is somewhat smaller, however,
has six fleshy horns instead of four, and the transverse
gold and black stripes are interspersed with white spots
instead of stripes. It feeds gregariously with the above
variety on the “Arbol de Seda,”  and appears at the
same time, in the same locality, and in equal numbers.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
When it changes to the pupa state it resembles closely
the bright green chrysalis of its companion, only it is
not quite so large.</p>


<h3>DANAIS ALCIPPOIDES.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Plate <abbr title="2">II</abbr>.&mdash;Fig. 3.</span></p>

<p>This butterfly, a variety of the Chrysippus, is rare in
Teneriffe. It is found commonly in Africa and Western
Asia, and is a transition variety between the Chrysippus
and Alcippus. It has whitish hind-wings, rather silvery
looking, with orange markings within the black border.
The hind-wings have less white upon them than those
of the Alcippus. It is similar in all respects and
habits, mode of feeding, etc., to the Chrysippus, and
is found gregariously with it. When kept collectively,
about one in fifty of the chrysalides proves
to be of this variety. The caterpillars of the three
varieties of Danais described are about four weeks
before turning to chrysalides, and remain in that
state from two to three weeks before emerging to
the imago.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span></p>


<h3>DANAIS DORIPPUS v. KLUGII.</h3>

<p>This is the fourth variety of the genus Danais, and is
authentically claimed as one of the Teneriffe butterflies,
though by no means commonly found. It varies from
the Chrysippus in having no brown apical patch on the
fore-wings, and it also has no band of white spots across
them. It measures from two and a half to three and a
half inches across the wings. It is not an inhabitant of
England, but is commonly found in North Africa and
Western Asia.</p>


<h3>ARGYNNIS MAIA (Cram), or PANDORA.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Plate <abbr title="3">III</abbr>.&mdash;Figs. 1 and 2.</span></p>

<p>This butterfly is one of the most beautiful Fritillarys,
and is also one of the largest of Teneriffe butterflies,
measuring in expanse from three and a half to four
inches.</p>

<p>It mostly frequents woods and meadows, not often
being met with below an altitude of fifteen hundred feet
above the sea. It is found in South Europe, and is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
also met with in Africa. The time of its appearance
commences in May, and continues during the summer
months. The larva is purplish-brown with black
markings; it feeds on heartsease. The upper and under
side differ greatly, as may be seen in the illustrations.
The prevailing colour of the upper surface is a beautiful
bronze green, tinged with yellow on the fore-wings. The
bronze green colour is freely marked all over by velvety
black oblong spots, dashes, and lines, the margin of each
wing having a continuous scalloped line of black. The
body and hind-wings are very feathered and downy. The
underside of the fore-wings is a brilliant pink-red and
black colour, with an apical patch of green, having
yellow markings. The hind-wings are green with a long
irregular stripe of silver down the centre of each, the
stripe being fringed on the outer edge by five silver
dots. There is a marginal silver band with a fine yellow
line running along the outer edge of the hind-wings.
The body is green on the upper, and buff-yellow on
the under-side, the legs being of the latter colour.
There is not much difference between the male and
female.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span></p>


<h3>ARGYNNIS LATHONIA.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Plate <abbr title="3">III</abbr>.&mdash;Figs. 3 and 4.</span></p>

<p>This exquisite butterfly, which is about two inches in
expanse, is known in England, where it is accounted a
great rarity, by the common name Queen of Spain
Fritillary, and it is not very commonly found in Teneriffe.
The caterpillar is a greyish brown with a white dorsal
line, spotted with black, and having two brownish lines
on the sides. The spines are reddish and the legs
yellow. It feeds on the heartsease, violet, etc. The upper
surface is a tawny orange colour with many distinct
rounded black spots. On the under-side the hind-wings
are brownish yellow with very large oval silver spots
interspersed with smaller ones. The fore-wings have
black spots of various sizes, and five or six apical silver
spots. The butterfly is found mostly on high ground in
barrancos; but also in fields and gardens from the
months of March to September, though in some years
it appears earlier. It flits quickly along the paths in
the barrancos, settling at short distances, very often<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
just out of reach of the net, and this liveliness often
necessitates a long walk after a specimen. The antennæ
are furnished with a round thick nob at the end. There
is no very marked difference in the male and female.</p>


<h3>PYRAMEIS ATALANTA.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Plate <abbr title="3">III</abbr>.&mdash;Fig. 7.</span></p>

<p>This richly-coloured butterfly, known in England as
the Red Admiral, is very rare in the Canary Islands.
The ground-colour of the upper surface of the fore-wings
is a velvety black, shading off to brown at the
base. A bright red oblique band crosses the wings,
and four large oblong white spots, with four or five
smaller ones, are grouped on the apex. These again
are bordered by several faint blue spots, quite at the tip.
The hind-wings are blackish brown, with a broad red
margin, in which are four black dots, and some blue
spots are marked on the lower angle of the wings. On
the underside the fore-wings are black, with several
steely blue lines, the red band across the centre being
clearly defined. The apex of the wings is brownish<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
yellow, marked with white. The hind-wings are most
beautifully variegated with steely blue, black, and buff.
The antennæ are long and slender, abruptly forming a
knot at the end, which is tipped with white. The larva
is dusky green in colour, with a yellow line running
down its back and sides; it is sparingly coloured with
short stubby hairs, and is found gregariously on the nettle-leaf.
Gold spots are freely sprinkled over the brown
chrysalis. The caterpillar stage lasts five or six weeks,
the butterfly appearing in another three or four. The
larva suspends itself by the tail, often wrapping itself in
a nettle-leaf, on which it feeds. If the pupa is gathered
from the nettles for breeding, it should be fastened in
the cage in the same position, head downwards. Disappointment
is often experienced in the number of
butterflies that emerge from the chrysalis state, so
many being attacked by ants, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The caterpillars are found gregariously with the
Callirhoe, which is the commonest species of Pyrameis
found in the Islands. Among many reared, three only
proved to be Atalanta butterflies. It is found in Teneriffe
from January to June.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span></p>


<h3>PYRAMEIS CALLIRHOE, or VULCANIA.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Plate <abbr title="3">III</abbr>.&mdash;Fig. 6.</span></p>

<p>This is the most common butterfly of the Pyrameis
genus found in the Islands. It is similar in colouring
to the last described, but it has a much broader red
oblique indented stripe on the fore-wings. The white
apical markings are not so many or large, and it has no
blue spots on the tips of the fore-wings.</p>

<p>The habits and locality of the caterpillar and chrysalis
are so like those of the Atalanta, that description is not
needed.</p>

<p>In rearing many specimens, two butterflies proved
to have bright yellow on the hind-wings in place of the
red band. Whether they are a distinct variety or not,
cannot at present be positively stated.<a name="fnanchor_5_5" id="fnanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<h3>PYRAMEIS CARDUI.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Plate <abbr title="2">II</abbr>.&mdash;Fig. 5.</span></p>

<p>This insect, which is the English Painted Lady,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
might at first sight be taken for a faded Atalanta.
The caterpillar lives generally solitary on hollyhock,
nettle, or mallow, curling itself up in a leaf It is of a
grey-brown colour, thickly sprinkled with hairs, a yellow
line fringed by reddish dots runs along each side. It is
found in most localities up to a considerable elevation,
from February till well on into the summer. The
butterfly is of a tawny red colour, shading off to brown
at the base of the fore-wings, with dark markings
and oblong black spots. The apex of the wings is
marked and edged in white, similar to the Atalanta.
The hind-wings are of the same tawny red colour,
having a line of five round black spots running along
each lower margin. The fore-wings are marked on the
under-side as above, the colour, however, being redder.
The hind-wings are pale buff, olive brown, and white,
having four or five blue-black eyes near the lower
margin, the two centre eyes being smaller than the
others, which are circled by black and white. Its flight
is very swift, and its erratic and rapid gyrations from
side to side make it a difficult specimen to net.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span></p>


<h3>PYRAMEIS v. HUNTERA.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Plate <abbr title="2">II</abbr>.&mdash;Fig. 4.</span></p>

<p>This is a scarce variety in Teneriffe of the butterfly just
described. It is commonly found in America, and some
few insects have been taken in England. It is similar
in colouring to the Cardui, but somewhat brighter. The
flight of the insect is steadier, and this, together with the
brightness in colour, distinguishes it from others of the
same family when seen flying in company. It is found
in barrancos and gardens, and has been netted in a
locality about 600 feet above the sea near Orotava,
together with the last two butterflies described. All
three specimens were seen flitting in company, the
Callirhoe and Cardui predominating in number, with a
few specimens of the Huntera dispersed among them.
The upper surface is brick-red, marked with black, the
fore-wings having a dark apical patch, with several white
spots. The hind-wings have five blue spots, encircled
by black, near the lower margin. Beneath, the fore<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>-wings
are of a most beautiful red colour, interspersed
with black, grey-brown, and white, and having two eyes
on the apex. The hind-wings are of a lovely grey-brown
tinge, liberally veined with white, having a
whitish uneven band down the centre. This band has
two large eyes, with blue centres outside it. On the
edge of the wings three grey-blue lines are seen, making
the tout ensemble a most exquisite reverse, and the
greatest contrast to the upper surface. It is usually
found from April to August. Though faded and small
specimens were found earlier, the beauty of the insect is
not seen till April. The caterpillar is brown, sparingly
covered with hairs, and has bright red spots down its
sides. It is rather larger than the Cardui larva.</p>


<h3>PARARGE XIPHIOIDES.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Plate <abbr title="3">III</abbr>.&mdash;Fig. 5.</span></p>

<p>This is not an English butterfly, though it is somewhat
similar to the Speckled Wood Argus (Parage Ægeria).
It is very commonly found in the Islands in most localities
up to three or four thousand feet above the sea.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
It measures in expanse from two and a half to three
inches. Those found early in the year are of a smaller
and duller colour than those netted later on. It is of a
rich brown colour, the fore-wings being freely marked
with orange-yellow spots. The hind-wings are plentifully
feathered at the base, and have a long dash of
yellow down them, with three dark eyes near the margin,
which is scalloped with faint white. The under-side of
the fore-wings is lighter in colour than the surface,
though similar in markings. The hind-wings are of a
uniform olive-brown shade, with a long uneven silvery
stripe half-way down the centre. There is no very
decided knob on the end of the antennæ, which only
thicken slightly towards the end.</p>


<h3>EPINEPHELE HISPULLA, or FORTUNATA (Alph.).</h3>

<p>This brown butterfly resembles the English Large
Meadow Brown (E. Janira), but is of a richer colour
and larger size, measuring in expanse about two and a
half to three inches. The female, which differs largely
from the male in colour and markings, is of an ashy-brown
colour, the fore-wings being orange-tawny,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
leaving only an uneven marginal band of grey-brown.
There is an apical eye of black, with a small white
centre. The hind-wings are ashy-grey, with a marginal
orange-tawny band. The body and base of the lower
wings are freely feathered. The under-side is similar in
colouring, only lighter; the apical eyes are more strongly
marked; the hind-wings are of an orange-brown tint,
the orange band being slightly defined on this side.
The male has no orange-tawny markings on the surface,
only a slight shade of yellow being seen on the fore-wings,
shimmering through the uniform brown colour of the
insect. There is a small black eye, with a white central
dot on the apex of each fore-wing. On the under-side the
fore-wings of the male are orange-tawny, the black eye
being larger and more pronounced than on the surface.
The hind-wings of the male are of a uniform olive-brown
colour. It is found in barrancos, meadows and rough
places, from the coast up to a moderately high altitude,
from April to September; the male appears first in the
greatest numbers, and towards June the female is also
found in great quantities. The caterpillar has not been
observed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span></p>


<h3>HIPPARCHIA STATILINUS.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Plate <abbr title="2">II</abbr>.&mdash;Fig. 7.</span></p>

<p>This is a brown butterfly common in many parts of
Southern and Central Europe, though not found in
England. It is a rare insect in Teneriffe, and is only
met with high up in the mountains, chiefly at Vilaflor,
and on the south part of the island, about July and
August. It measures in expanse from two to three
inches, and is of a uniform brown colour, having a few
white markings, which vary much in different specimens,
on the fore-wings. Two large brown spots are seen at
the outer margin of each fore-wing, interspersed with
small white spots. The hind-wings are brown, shading
to lighter colour at the base. The under-side is prettily
mottled, and streaked with grey-brown, the two dark
spots seen on the margin being well defined. The larva
and chrysalis have not been observed.</p>


<h3>HESPERIA ACTÆON.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Plate <abbr title="2">II</abbr>.&mdash;Fig. 8.</span></p>

<p>This is a small Skipper, the only member of this family<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
found in Teneriffe. It resembles the English Lulworth
Skipper, and frequents damp places near the water-courses,
though somewhat partial and scarce. In a
limited spot near Orotava it has been found in quantities;
and at Tacoronti, where butterflies abound, some
have been taken. The whole surface is of an orange-bronze
colour with slight brown markings. The antennæ
are short and club-like; the head is large, and the body
thickish. It is found from April till June, but solitary
specimens are sometimes met with earlier in the year.</p>

<h3>ACHERONTIA ATROPOS.</h3>
</div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Plate <abbr title="4">IV</abbr>.&mdash;Fig. 1.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is the largest moth found in the Canary Islands,
known as the Death’s Head, very rarely met with in
England.</p>

<p>It measures from five to six inches in expanse. The
ground-colour of the fore-wings is brown, varied with
zig-zag lines of whitish yellow and light brown. There
is a white dot in the centre of each, and they are
dusted all over with minute white dots. The hind-wings
are orange, with two black marginal bands on
the lower edge. The head is dark brown or black,
marked with a pale-brown skull. The body is orange,
with a longitudinal band of bluish grey down the centre,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
increasing in width towards the base. Six bands of
black, broadest near the head, cross the body. The
antennæ are rather short and thick, tipped with white.
The caterpillar measures about four inches in length,
and is of a most gorgeous green and yellow colour,
alternate transverse bands of these colours running
along the sides. It has eight small eyes in a line
below the transverse bands, and a horn on its tail. It
feeds on the potato, the pupa making a cell for itself
underground, and appearing in the largest numbers
between May and July; but as a fresh crop of potatoes
is planted every three months in the Canaries, the
caterpillars are found in small numbers all the year
round.</p>

<p>When bred in captivity the pupa is delicate, quite
five out of ten dying in their cases.</p>


<h3>SPHINX CONVOLVULI or BATATÆ.</h3>

<p>This moth is found in England, and all over Europe.
It is a large moth, measuring about five inches across
the wings. All four wings are of a variegated grey<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>-brown
colour, the body having a longitudinal grey
stripe, increasing in width at the base, and five stripes
of pink and black across it alternately. The antennæ
are somewhat longer and more slender than those of
the Death’s Head moth. They are feathered, and grey
in colour, terminating in a sharp point. The insect is
provided with a very long proboscis, which one sees it
inserting into the centre of the flowers at dusk. During
the winter months it is met with commonly in some
years. The caterpillar, which measures four inches in
length, feeds on the sweet potato in the fields, and on
the petunia and phlox in gardens. It is of a brown-grey
colour, shading to green on the back, having
black longitudinal stripes along the back, and transverse
black and white stripes surmounted by white
spots at the sides. It is a night-feeder, hiding itself
under the leaves or in the ground at day-time, and
constructing the pupa-case underground. It is delicate
and difficult to rear in captivity, like the Atropos.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span></p>

<h3>DEILEPHILA TITHYMALI.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Plate <abbr title="4">IV</abbr>.&mdash;Fig. 4.</span></p>

<p>This beautiful moth is peculiar to the Canary Islands,
although allied species are found over the greater
part of Europe.<a name="fnanchor_6_6" id="fnanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> It expands from three to three and
a half inches. The fore-wings are silvery grey in
colour, having dark olive-grey markings, and a long
stripe of this colour, increasing in width towards the
body, from the apex to the base. The hind-wings are
a rich pink, having a marginal band of dark brown, and
a fine white line on the outer edge. The antennæ,
which are white, are thick and feathered. The head
and body, thickly feathered with white, are of an olive
brown colour. Two bands of black cross the top of
the abdomen, which tapers off to a point, with bands of
alternate white and olive brown slightly marked with
black. The caterpillar is easily found on the Euphorbia
where it feeds gregariously. It is a beautiful dark pink,
the horn being of this colour. The dark pink is interspersed
with dusky green and greyish black spots, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
the caterpillar, when at full size, attains a length of
about four inches. It is found from January till the
end of May, but in the greatest numbers in April,
whilst the Euphorbia is in its prime. The road-side
between Rambla and Icod is a particularly favoured
spot. About one or two inches of dried earth prepared
as already mentioned are required for the larva to
make its slight case in, though when in a natural state
it buries itself much deeper, and the pupa is difficult
to find. Some were fed and reared on a species of
milk-wort. They thrived, but eventually turned into
small moths of a paler colour than usual. The pupa
varies much in the time of turning to the moth stage,
according to the weather,&mdash;from six weeks, the usual
time, to three months. Some caterpillars obtained in
January did not become moths till the end of March;
others taken at full growth on March 15th effected
their last change to the moth during the last week in
April and first week in May. The pupa when it first
turns is of a beautiful shaded green colour with yellowish
markings, but it changes to a uniform brown in
a few days. The caterpillar is sometimes affected by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
a disease which consists of a small red fungus growing
on the body, generally towards the tail. One small
brood was entirely lost from this disease, which seemed
to be contagious. As a rule, however, the larvæ are
easy to keep, and the chrysalides hatch well and strongly.
When numbers are kept, an old wine-case should be
substituted for the smaller breeding-cages already mentioned,
the mosquito-netting being used in the same
way. A little sun is beneficial to them every day in
the morning. When kept too long in the sun, however,
they cease to feed, although when in a natural
state sunny localities are most favoured. They are not
night-feeders only.</p>

<h3>CHŒROCAMPA CELERIO.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Plate <abbr title="4">IV</abbr>.&mdash;Fig. 2.</span></p>

<p class="center">(<em>Sharp Winged Hawk-Moth.</em>)</p>

<p>This beautiful moth is somewhat allied to the last described,
the colour being similar, but the body is longer
and more tapering. It is found in England, and in most
countries where the vine grows, on which it feeds. The
fore-wings are greyish brown with a silvery grey stripe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
from the apex to the base; the outer lower margin is
bordered by a similar stripe. The hind-wings are of a
rosy pink colour, veined with, and having a marginal
band of brown. The body is feathered, and has a series
of five short silver streaks down each side. The antennæ
are greyish white, not so long as those of the Tithymali.
From three to four inches is the length of the beautiful
bright green caterpillar. This has two dark and two
light spots on its head, and a horn on its tail. A faint
yellow longitudinal line runs along each side. It is
rather liable to the attacks of the ichneumon fly, and
so it is as well to search for the eggs before putting it
aside for rearing. This year (1893) some were found in
April, this being unusually early, as it does not appear
generally till June, from which date until August it is
very commonly met with in the vineyards. The pupa
lies in a dormant state for four weeks, and then turns to
the moth freely and strongly.</p>

<h3>MACROGLOSSA STELLATARUM.</h3>

<p class="center">(<em>Humming Bird Hawk-Moth.</em>)</p>

<p>This moth is common in England and most parts of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
Europe. Its fore-wings are brown, with faint longitudinal
lines of a darker shade; the hind-wings are orange
tawny, fringed with light brown. It measures in expanse
about two inches. The head and body are brown,
the abdomen spotted with black and white, rather
liberally feathered. The antennæ are brown, being
thinnest at the base, and gradually thickening to the
extremity. It is seen in the daytime, as well as evening
hovering, with an ever-restless motion of the wing, over
flowers. The caterpillar is green, with a longitudinal
white stripe, and a faint yellow one under the spiracles.
The time of its appearance is from March to September,
but it is seen about in greatest numbers in June.</p>


<h3>RHYPARIOIDES RUFESCENS.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Plate <abbr title="4">IV</abbr>.&mdash;Fig. 5.</span></p>

<p>This pretty moth is peculiar to the Islands, measuring
rather more than two inches across the wings. It is
red in colour, the hind-wings being brighter than the
fore-wings. These latter are marked with longitudinal
dark stripes in the female, dark spots being substituted for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
the stripes in the male. The head is dark red, shading off
to lighter red on the richly-feathered body. The antennæ
are red, being thicker and more feathered in the male than
the female. The caterpillars are brown, thickly covered
with long silky hairs, and are found mostly in barrancos,
feeding on the dock and sorrel singly. They are also
found in gardens, feeding somewhat indiscriminately on
cabbage or hollyhock. When kept in captivity they can
be reared on cabbage, and after attaining their full size
of about one and a half inches, they make a slight hairy
cocoon under a thin covering of earth. The caterpillar
stage lasts about twenty days. They are found in
January and hibernate in the pupa state till well on in
the summer, sometimes as late as October or November,
though some taken in January were brought to England
and turned to moths on the 24th of June following.
After being kept for a time the chrysalides become a
very dark brown, almost black, so that there is a temptation
to throw them away as dead, since they show
so little life; but on opening the hard, stick-like skin,
the creature is found to be quite fresh.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span></p>

<h3>DASYCHIRA FORTUNATA.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Plate <abbr title="4">IV</abbr>.</span>&mdash;Fig. 11.</p>

<p>In colour a dull grey moth. The fore-wings are ash-coloured,
variegated with whitish on the upper side. The
reniform spot is rust-coloured in the male and whitish
in the female. The transverse lines are black and
dentated, the submarginal line maculated. The hind-wings
are grey, with a slight lunule in the middle; the
underside uniform grey. The body is less stout than
the D. Fascelina (Linn.). The abdomen is long in the
male and longer in the female. The antennæ are pectinated
in the male, simple in the female. The legs are
thickly clothed with hair, the feet yellowish beneath.
Although the caterpillar has not been described, it presumably
has much the same characteristics as its allies,
and is probably greyish, with tufts of hair on its back;
it feeds on the Pinus Canariensis.</p>

<p>This moth is allied to the English, and European
species Dasychira Fascelina (Dark Tussock), but is
probably peculiar to the Islands. It has been described
as being found in the Islands of Palma and Hiero by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
Rogenhofer in the “Verhandlungen des Kaiserlich-Königlichen
Zoologisch-botanischen Gesellschaft in
Wien,”  vol. 41 (for 1891), p. 566. The specimen
illustrated was drawn from one of two presented to the
South Kensington Museum by the Rev. O. E. Benthall,
who found the chrysalides on trunks of the Canary pine
near Guimar, Teneriffe, about 2,000 feet above the sea,
and as far as the author can ascertain it has not before
been recorded as occurring in Teneriffe.</p>


<h3>DEIOPEIA PULCHELLA.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Plate <abbr title="4">IV</abbr>.&mdash;Fig. 9.</span></p>

<p>This beautiful little moth, expanding about one and
a half inches, is a very rare insect in Teneriffe at the
present time, though two or three years ago it was
found in great abundance near, and along, the coast
during the spring months.<a name="fnanchor_7_7" id="fnanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> It has yellowish white
fore-wings freely spotted with black, alternated with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
oblong red spots, not so numerous. The hind-wings
are pearl-white, having a small blackish brown spot
towards the top, and a marginal indented border of
the same colour. The thorax and head are speckled
with black and yellow. The body is light pearl-grey.
The larva is dark grey with a broad white stripe on the
back and reddish streaks on the sides. This species is
abundant throughout Africa, the South of Asia and
Europe, but a very scarce insect in England. Don
Ramon Gomez kindly supplied the specimen illustrated.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="footnote_7_7" id="footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#fnanchor_7_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a>A single specimen was taken by the Rev. O. E. Benthall at Guimar in
1893.
</p></div>


<h3>PSEUDOPHIA TIRHACA (Cram); wrongly called
TYRRHÆA.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Plate <abbr title="4">IV</abbr>.&mdash;Fig. 3.</span></p>

<p>This is not an English species, but is met with in
Europe and North Africa. It is not very commonly found
in Teneriffe. The fore-wings are green, with a central
reddish-brown spot, the outer margin having an indented
band of the same colour. The body and hind-wings,
richly feathered, are a beautiful straw yellow, the latter
having a dark brown graduated band near the lower<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
margin. It expands about two inches and a half. The
larva is grey, with a pale grey stripe on the sides, and
black spots on the lower surface between the pro-legs.</p>


<h3>CALOCAMPA EXOLETA.</h3>

<p class="center">(<em>Sword-Grass Moth.</em>)</p>

<p>This moth is an English species. It measures in
expanse between two and three inches, and is of a
soft violet grey tinge, the fore-wings having a variety
of brown markings. The caterpillar feeds on the
Euphorbia, and has been found gregariously with the
Tithymali on that plant. It is met with, however, on
peas and potatoes, and can be reared on the leaves of
any of these plants. The larva is bright green, with
two lines of black and white spots down each side of the
back. These are bordered by a yellow stripe (sometimes,
however, absent), and it has a broken red line on each
side. The caterpillar attains a length of about three
inches. Some were kept in the same breeding cage with
the Tithymali, but their habits were entirely different.
When the Exoleta caterpillar ceased to feed, it did not
immediately attain the pupa state, but was restless and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
lively, remaining as a caterpillar from six to eight weeks,
gradually shrinking and losing its colour, until it turned
to the pupa. It made a fragile shell of fine earth, oval
in form, and buried itself a short distance under the
surface. Full-sized caterpillars, taken on the 20th of
March, ceased feeding and turned to the pupa state
from the 1st to the 20th of May, emerging to the moth
on the 15th of June. In some specimens the process
of turning to the pupa took place on the journey to
England in a box, the caterpillars being covered lightly
with cotton-wool.</p>


<h3>TRIPHÆNA PRONUBA.</h3>

<p class="center">(<em>Common Yellow Underwing.</em>)</p>

<p>This is a common moth in England and Europe, but is
rather a scarce species in Teneriffe. It expands a little
more than two inches. The fore-wings are dark brown,
having a few irregular markings of a lighter shade.
The hind-wings are bright yellow, with a dark brown
marginal band on the lower edge. The body is a somewhat
lighter brown, and the antennæ are long and fine.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
The caterpillar is brown, and it feeds on a variety of low-growing
plants in the barrancos, and may also be found
on the potato. It commences to appear in the early
spring.</p>


<h3>PLUSIA AURIFERA.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Plate <abbr title="4">IV</abbr>.&mdash;Fig. 6.</span></p>

<p>This moth is closely allied to the Chrysitis, which is
found in England, differing, however, in the shape of
the gold markings.<a name="fnanchor_8_8" id="fnanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> The fore-wings have a bright
golden marginal band of varying width across them,
from the apex to the base. It is found in rough places,
and can be easily netted when hovering over clover-flowers
or similar low-growing herbage at dusk. The
hind-wings are grey-brown, shading off to a lighter tint
towards the body. The antennæ are long and fine.
The caterpillar feeds on the tobacco-plant, and is found
in barrancos, but it is most usually met with on potato-plants;
it envelops itself in a leaf, drawing it together<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
with silk-like threads, and so forming a case in which it
turns to the chrysalis. It is found very nearly all the
year round, but is met with in greatest numbers during
the spring months.</p>

<h3>PLUSIA TRIPARTITA (Hufn.) URTICÆ (Hübn).</h3>

<p>Known in England as the Spectacle Moth. It is met
with in the day-time as well as at dusk, like many
others of the genus Plusia. Its fore-wings are dark
grey, varied with greenish-white in the basal and marginal
areas; the sub-terminal line is marked below the
costa with black arrow-heads in front, and is bordered
with deep black behind. It is common in the greater
part of Europe and Northern Asia. The larva, which
is greenish brown, has two white lines on the back, and
slender white and green lines along each side above the
feet. It feeds on nettle.</p>

<h3>PLUSIA CIRCUMFLEXA.</h3>

<p>Similar somewhat to the English Gamma, or silver Y
moth, but a distinct variety, and found largely in Europe.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
The fore-wings are dark ashy-grey, with bronze
markings, and have a pale golden mark in the middle
resembling the letter r. The hind-wings are brown, of
a lighter shade towards the base. It measures in expanse
about two inches; the antennæ are long and fine.
The larva, which is green with a yellowish stripe at the
sides, feeds on the potato and other low-growing plants,
and is found during the early spring months, and well
on into the summer.</p>


<h3>PLUSIA ERIOSOMA.</h3>

<p>This is the fourth species described here of the large
genus Plusia. It is a much brighter golden-brown
colour than the last described specimen, measuring about
one and a half inches across the wings. The fore-wings
are golden-brown, having two distinct gold spots about
the centre. The hind are of the same tint as the fore-wings,
darker at the margin, and shading off lighter
towards the base. It is found in India, but is not a
European species.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span></p>


<h3>HELIOTHIS ARMIGERA.</h3>

<p>This is a very rare moth in England, but is found
over the greater part of the world. It expands about
one and a half inches.

The fore-wings are a brownish yellow, with darker
indistinct markings. The hind-wings are lighter yellow
in colour, with a dark semi-lunar spot in the middle,
and have a dark marginal border. The antennæ are long
and fine. The caterpillar was found on the potato-plant
and proved to be one of the cannibal species. It fed
occasionally on the food provided, but seemed generally
to prefer its companions in captivity, feeding at night,
and so had to be separated from them. The larva is
reddish brown in colour, with a yellowish stripe on the
sides, and it is very commonly found in Teneriffe during
the early spring months.</p>


<h3>HELIOTHIS DIPSACEA.</h3>

<p>This is a small moth, about one to one and a half inches
in expanse, and found throughout the greater part of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
Europe, Northern and Western Asia, and North Africa.
It frequents high ground in the spring and summer,
living in rough places and in clover-fields. The fore-wings
are of light olive-brown shade, with dark markings
across them. The hind-wings are dark olive-brown,
fringed with yellow, and having two large yellow uneven
spots about the centre, with a similar one on the brown
margin. The body is stout, the antennæ long and fine.
The larva is green or rust-colour, with white lines on
the back and sides.</p>


<h3>PRODENIA LITTORALIS.</h3>

<p>A moth, expanding about one inch and a half, found
in Africa, but not in England. It has brown-grey fore-wings,
with opalescent markings. The hind-wings are
of a shining opalescent white. The larva is brown, feeds
on the potato-plant, and appears during the early spring.
The moths are seen a month or six weeks later; those
bred in captivity appear simultaneously with those out
of doors.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span></p>


<h3>PERIDROMA SAUCIA.</h3>

<p>Rather a fine moth, inhabiting Europe, though not
found in England. It expands about two inches or
more. The fore-wings are dark brown, sometimes
suffused with a reddish tinge at the upper margin.
The hind-wings are of a greyish pearl-white colour,
veined with brown, with a brown shade fringing the
margins. The larva is greyish-brown, and feeds on the
potato-plant, where it is found during the late winter
and early spring. The average time for turning from
the larva to the moth stage is from six to eight weeks.</p>


<h3>TARACHE LUCIDA.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Plate <abbr title="4">IV</abbr>.&mdash;Fig. 8.</span></p>

<p>This is a small moth, not very commonly found in
Teneriffe. It is met with by day along the coast, and
up to an altitude of 2000 feet or more in rough rocky
places, in April and up to June or July. The prevailing
colour is a blue-grey. The fore-wings have a large<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
square patch of white on the upper margin, and a
smaller dot of the same colour towards the middle. The
hind-wings are fringed with white, and have two or
three patches of the same colour along their margins.
In the male, the white on both wings is increased
towards the base. It is not an English species, but is
found in Europe and along the Mediterranean. The
larva is a green or brownish grey, with three dark
double lines on the thoracic segments; tufted, and with
a white line on the back on segments 5 to 7, and with a
dark stripe on the back, and a whitish line on the sides
of the remaining segments.</p>


<h3>STERRHA SACRARIA.</h3>

<p>A pretty little moth, about one inch in expanse, commonly
found in the Canary Islands. It is widely
dispersed over Europe and Asia, and is a rare inhabitant
of England. The fore-wings are sulphur-yellow, tinged
with bright red at the apex, and having a red line
running from the tip to the middle of the inner margin.
The hind-wings are pale yellowish white. It frequents<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
rough places among short herbage, and is found on
and near the coast in the early spring and during the
summer. The larva is green, with a paler line on the
back, and a yellowish line on the sides. Spiracles red.
It feeds on low-growing plants.</p>


<h3>OMMOTOSTOLA SACCHARI.</h3>

<p>A pale buff moth, measuring in expanse about two
inches. The specimen described was netted at Guimar,
Teneriffe, in May. It is somewhat common. The fore-wings
and body are buff, the latter being rather richly
feathered. The hind-wings are cream-white; the
antennæ are rather thick, of a medium length. It is
not an inhabitant of Europe. The larva has not been
observed.</p>


<h3>HYPENA OBSITALIS.</h3>

<p>Not an English moth, but an inhabitant of South
Europe, North Africa, and Asia. It measures in expanse
about one inch. The fore-wings are brown, varied with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
pale yellow and black markings. The hind-wings are
grey, shading lighter at the base. It makes its appearance
in the spring, and is very commonly found in
dwelling-houses or surrounding out-houses in the evening.
The larva is green, with a white stripe on the sides.</p>


<h3>HYPENA LIVIDALIS.</h3>

<p>A smaller moth than the last specimen described.
The fore-wings are olive-brown, violet-grey towards the
margins. The two colours are separated by an oblique
whitish line from the apex to the middle of the inner
margin. The hind-wings are grey, shading off lighter to
the base, and are veined with brown. It is not an
English species, but is very commonly found in Teneriffe,
on rough ground, among cactus, &amp;c., in the early
spring, at no great distance from the coast. It inhabits
South Europe, North Africa, and Western Asia.</p>


<h3>OMPHACODES DIVINCTA.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Plate <abbr title="4">IV</abbr>.&mdash;Fig. 7.</span></p>

<p>A pretty little sea-green moth (geometra) found in
South Africa, but very rarely met with in Teneriffe. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
was netted in a rough place among cactus-plants in
April at dusk, about 500 feet above the sea level. It
measures about one inch in expanse; the fore-wings and
upper part of the body are of a beautiful bright sea-green
colour when first netted, but the insect quickly
fades. The hind-wings are paler green, and all four
wings are fringed with white. The antennæ are short
and slightly feathered.</p>

<p>This moth had not figured in any collection of
Teneriffe moths as far as the author could ascertain.
No observations have been made on the larvæ and pupæ.</p>


<h3>ASPILATES COLLINARIA. (Holt-White.)</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Plate <abbr title="4">IV</abbr>.&mdash;Fig. 10</span> (Female).</p>

<p>This moth is allied to the Aspilates Gilvaria, but is
probably an insect peculiar to the Canaries. It measures
in expanse about one inch. It is of a pale buff-colour,
the female being of a much intenser shade than
the male. The hind-wings in both sexes are much
lighter in colour than the fore-wings. The fore-wings<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
of the female have a slate-blue narrow band of colour,
extending from near the apex to the base of the
upper margin, forming a semicircle. Within the
semicircle, and near the upper margin, is a small
slate-blue dot. The hind-wings have also a band of
varying width and of the same colour extending across
them, and a slate-blue dot is seen near the top of the upper
margin above the slate band. The male has
similar markings, but they are much paler, and not
nearly so well defined. The antennæ of the male are
feathered, of medium length; those of the female are
longer and finer. At first sight this moth might be
deemed a variety of Sterrha Sacraria. The female was
taken at Guimar about 1000 feet above the sea.
Several male specimens were taken near Orotava, at a
somewhat higher altitude. This moth, being unknown
at South Kensington, has been named as above by the
author.</p>


<h3>BRYOPHILA var. RAVULA (Hübn).</h3>

<p>A small moth, about one inch in expanse, with a
slender body. The fore-wings are dark brown, with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
the base, tip, and inner margin whitish. The centre of
the wings is suffused with red, and two transverse lines
of darker colour cross them. The larva is blue with a
black line on the back and a zigzag yellowish-red stripe
on the sides, bordered below with black. It feeds on
lichens growing on walls. It is not a British species,
but is met with in Southern Europe.</p>


<h3>BRYOPHILA ALGÆ (Fabr.).</h3>

<p>This is a small moth, with the same characteristics as
to size and form as the last described. The fore-wings
are green, varied with brown and blackish in the
position of the claviform stigma. It has dark transverse
lines, and the hind-wings are brownish grey.
The larva is bluish-grey, with a grey stripe on the back.
It feeds on lichen, and inhabits Central and Southern
Europe, and Western Asia, but is a great rarity in
England.</p>


<h3>AGROTIS SPINIFERA (Hübn).</h3>

<p>This is a moth somewhat larger than the last-described,
with rather a stout body. It is fawn-colour, the ab<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>domen
pale-brown, and the margin of the fore-wings
has several black spots. The hind-wings are whitish.
It inhabits South-Western Europe, but is not met with
in England.</p>


<h3>SESAMIA NONAGRIOIDES (Lef.).</h3>

<p>The body of this moth is stout, the fore-wings are
nearly rectangular at the tips, without any distinct
pattern. The antennæ and tongue are short. The
fore-wings are greyish-yellow with a black discal spot,
and an outer row of black dots. The hind-wings are
white. It inhabits Spain, North Africa, and Madeira,
but is not a British species. The larva lives on the
stalks of maize, corn, and sugar-cane.</p>


<h3>ACIDALIA CONSOLIDATA.</h3>

<p>One of the large genus of Acidalia, a small and
delicate moth. The wings are yellowish-white, finely
dusted with black. The fore-wings have five and the
hind-wings four brownish yellow transverse bands. It
expands about one inch. It is not a British species.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span></p>


<h3>ZONOSOMA PUPILLARIA (Hübn).</h3>

<p>A small moth, with the tips of the fore-wings pointed.
The wings are greyish yellow, finely and indistinctly
speckled with purplish brown, with a small brown
central spot centred with white, a row of black dots
beyond the middle, and often a dull red, zigzag central
shade also. This is a very variable species, inhabiting
S. Europe, W. Asia, and N. Africa, but is not an inhabitant
of England. The larva is very variable in
colour, being dull green, brown, or reddish. It feeds on
the cistus, arbutus, myrtle, etc.</p>


<h3>TEPHRONIA SEPIARIA (Hufn).</h3>

<p>A small moth, with narrow fore-wings, expanding
about one inch. The fore-wings are ashy-grey, finely
dusted with a darker shade. The hind-wings are paler,
with two dark marginal bands. It is met with in
Central and Southern Europe, but is very rare in
Britain. The larva is brownish grey, with a paler
line and two rows of pale spots on the back.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span></p>


<h3>EUPITHECIA PUMILATA (Hübn).</h3>

<p>The fore-wings are pointed, reddish grey in colour,
and bordered by a brownish-red band. The larva is
pale yellowish-green, with dark green or reddish-violet
lines on the back, and a paler line on its sides. It
feeds on the flowers of a great variety of plants, such
as clematis, broom, convolvulus. It is widely distributed
in Central and Southern Europe and W. Asia,
but is not an inhabitant of Britain.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span></p>

<p>In addition to the specimens above described, a list of
twenty-one more names of Teneriffe moths is appended,
which have been written upon by S. Alpheraky in the
memoirs of N. M. Romanoff, vol. v., 1889. Several of
the insects in this list were collected by the author, but
as they were mostly very small brown or grey moths,
and of but little interest to the ordinary collector, a
description of them has been omitted. The difficulty
of identification without illustration also precludes their
insertion in a work of the present character.</p>

<hr class="r10" />

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Scott Wilson</span>, writing to the author of his visit to
the Isle of Palma, states that the Queen of Spain Fritillary
(Argynnis Lathonia) is very common in the meadows
near the town of El Paso, 2000 feet above the sea level
in May. In the same month he noticed the clouded
yellow (Colias Edusa) in large numbers in the clearings
amongst the pine-woods. A few specimens of the large
Fritillary (Argynnis Maia) were secured by him at El
Paso early in May, where the Vulcania was also found;
of these latter specimens only two out of one hundred
proved to be of the British form Atalanta. The Bath-white
(Pieris Daplidice) was common near Argual.</p>

<p>The Danais Chrysippus appeared rather uncommon,
only a few specimens being taken near the barranco Del
Carmen, not far from the town of Santa Cruz, and a
few near Tijarafe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span></p>

<p>Specimens of the small blue (Lycaena Webbiana)
were taken near Argual.</p>

<p>In the middle of May the large white (Pieris Cheiranthi)
was commonly found on the large laurel-trees
at La Galga.</p>

<p>The author believes that the same species of Lepidoptera
are generally distributed over all the seven
islands, but that in Fuerteventura and Lanzarote,
both of which are dry, sandy, and somewhat barren
islands, they are not found in such numbers or variety.
It is probable that different species of small African
moths, some of which are enumerated on pages 93-4,
may be found in Lanzarote, which is the nearest
island to the coast of Africa, and which more closely
resembles it in climate and vegetation, in greater
numbers than in Teneriffe. The Euphorbia, which
grows so plentifully in most of the islands, is uncommon
in Lanzarote; hence the D. Tithymali,
abundant in Teneriffe, would be scarce in this island.
The lack of water in Fuerteventura, and consequent
sparse vegetation, is doubtless the cause of the scarcity
of Lepidoptera in that island, though the interesting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
occurrence of the insect “Euchlöe Charlonia,”  a North
and West African butterfly (which has only once been
recorded as having been observed in Teneriffe), is
accounted for by the proximity of the island in
question to the African mainland. This species
probably occurs in Lanzarote, for the same reason;
it will doubtless become dispersed over the remaining
islands in time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Several</span> of the Teneriffe moths, although similar to
English and European species, assume rather a darker
insular form. The Triphæna Pronuba, Calocampa
Exoleta and Asopia Farinalis are examples of this. The
Sterrha Sacraria is also met with marked with a
much brighter red than in ordinary specimens, and
showing great diversity in shade of colour, from red
to almost yellow. Anyone wishing to acquire more
knowledge on this subject should refer to “Observations
on some remarkable Varieties of Sterrha Sacraria,
with general notes on Variation in Lepidoptera, by
R. M. McLachlan, F.L.S.”  Transactions of the Entomological
Society of London, Ser. 3, vol. ii, pp. 453-468,
pl. 23.</p>

<p>Those who are interested in the subject, and have
sufficient time and patience, would probably be well<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
repaid for their trouble by the result of experiments
in selecting and breeding together insects of the same
species which exhibit any slight deviation in their
markings and colour. Thus in rearing a number of
the Pyrameis Callirhoe several specimens have been
observed to emerge from the chrysalis state with bright
yellow instead of red markings on the margins of
the hind-wings. The white markings on the upper
wings also varied somewhat. The Pyrameis family
would possibly lend itself freely to the production of
new varieties. The Danais Chrysippus is another species
of butterfly which presents itself for experiment. By
selecting the lighter hind-wing variety, Alcippoides, for
breeding, perhaps the Alcippus, which hitherto has
not been found in Teneriffe, might be produced.
Among the smaller butterflies, the Chrysophanus
Phlœas, and the Astrarche var. Aestiva have both
shown deviation in colour and markings, but these
are much smaller, and consequently more difficult to
rear. Moreover, they would not lend such an interest
to the subject as the larger specimens.</p>

<p>In the moths, the Deilephila Tithymali caterpillars,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
if fed on a species of milk-wort, evince a slight variety
in colouring and size of moths as compared with
those fed on Euphorbia. They must, however, be fed
on the plant from the earliest stage, as they only thrive
on the food to which they have been accustomed from
the first. Some of the earliest specimens are occasionally
found on the milk-wort, the eggs having been
deposited thereon. Those found in January are more
likely to thrive on this food than those met with later
on, as the Euphorbia, on which they generally feed, is
not in its prime till the early spring.</p>

<p>Great care, patience, and time are required for
these most interesting experiments, but the natural
advantages of the climate of Teneriffe would greatly
facilitate any efforts made, as the variation in temperature
is so slight, and consequently the breeding process
can be carried on nearly all the year round. Experiments
of this nature, which might pleasantly be made by
those with whom time might otherwise pass slowly
in Teneriffe, would probably prove of distinct value
to students of Biology.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> “Deilephila Daucus,”  allied to “Lineata,”  a
North American species, is said to occur in Teneriffe,
but the author has not seen a specimen. If such a
species is really found in the island, it is more probably
D. Livornica, which is common in South Europe and
throughout Africa, and is found in Madeira. Either
of the above species may be distinguished from D.
Tithymali by the white lines on the wings, but D.
Livornica has only four longitudinal white stripes on
the thorax, whereas D. Daucus has six. D. Livornica
is a rarity in England, but is found throughout all
the warmer parts of the Old World.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, &#8220;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
